# Tele-Autonomous-Humanoid-Robots-for-Health-Care-Applications-

       We will implement the object detection technique with the Oculus VR    
       headset and Real sense depth camera and try to setup a pipeline to   
       manipulate the KUKA arm/ASHA Robot by intent-based vision detection.  
       Furthermore, we will also be interested in developing a Prediction Engine  
       that can shape a cultivated understanding of the world from the current 
       scene and their previous knowledge via an autonomous lifelong    
        development.
